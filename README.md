# Student-directory

> The week 4 intro to github markdown and running scripts from github

The project required a gradual build up of a ruby program to list
a number of students. It went from a simple puts of students in
step 1, to saving and loading of a file.

The project was very detailed and had step by step instructions
encouraging us to type every bit in instead of copy and pasting.

Detailed below are the steps taken to reach the final product.
Comments are added to newly implemented sections to keep track
of everything.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

## Overview of steps in week 4

### Step 1: Setting up the environment

The basics of creating a new file, creating a new repo on Github
and tying them together. This readme file was created in that first
step and has been updated since.

### Step 2: Printing the list of students

Starts off with simple puts commands of a bunch of evil villains... or heroes
depending on which perspective you take.

> **Added:** A total count of lines in the list

### Step 3: Refactoring

The beginning of making things more stream-lined and `style guide` friendly.

> **Added:** First implementation of a variable

### Step 4: Arrays

The implementation of using arrays to store the names. The introduction of the first method to be used; `.each` scrolls through the array and prints out each name on a
separate line.

> **Added:** Dropped the names into an array

> **Added:** .each to cycle through the names

> **Removed** Hard coded puts of names
