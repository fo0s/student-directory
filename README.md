# Student-directory

> The week 4 intro to github markdown and running scripts from github

The project required a gradual build up of a ruby program to list
a number of students. It went from a simple puts of students in
step 1, to saving to and loading of a file.

The project was very detailed and had step by step instructions

Comments are added to newly implemented sections to keep track
